<h2>About WSO2 Storage Server </h2>

<p>WSO2 Storage Server conveniently delivers multi-tenant structured and unstructured data storage to development projects. Development teams can rapidly provision and access secure and scalable relational, NoSQL Columnar, and Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) repositories using a consistent management process. The WSO2 Storage Server management console allows teams to create Databases, add users, and provision access based on the web application’s database policies.
<br/><br/>
Our cloud-aware WSO2 Storage Server supports elastic scalability, on-demand self-service provisioning, and consumption based pricing models. The server publishes usage data to WSO2 Business Activity Monitor and enables advanced analytics, monitoring, and billing.

<p>WSO2 Storage Server 1.5.0 is developed on top of the revolutionary
    <a href="http://wso2.org/projects/carbon">Carbon platform</a>
    (Middleware a' la carte), and is based on the OSGi framework to achieve the
    better modularity for your SOA architecture. This also contains a lots of new
    features and many other optional components to customize the behavior of the
    server. Further, if you do not want any of the built in features, you can
    uninstall those features without any trouble. In other words, this Storage Server can be
    customized to your SOA needs.</p>

<h2>About WSO2 Carbon </h2>

<p>WSO2 Carbon is a component based Enterprise SOA platform. The
    design of
    WSO2 Carbon focuses on separating the key functionality of the SOA
    platform
    into separate pluggable Carbon components that can be mixed and
    matched, like
    customizable building blocks. This allows you to add only the
    functionality
    you need to start up, and continue to add product capabilities
    as your
    requirements grow. This helps a business to quickly adapt to
    changes.</p>

<p>OSGi is used as the underlying core modularization technology
    to build the
    Carbon platform. The Carbon framework is shipped with Eclipse Equinox
    by
    default, but can be supported on Spring dm Server, Felix or Knoplerfish
    if
    required. The OSGi technology even allows you to write your business
    functionality as an OSGi component and deploy it in the existing Carbon
    platform. </p>

<p> For a quick start on using the WSO2 Carbon
    platform, the Carbon components are pre-assembled into <a href="http://wso2.com/products/">a set of products</a>. </p>

<p>You can assemble your own products by combining
    components and
    deploying them in a preferred architecture. </p>

<p>The WSO2 Carbon platform gives maximum flexibility to adapt
    the middleware
    to your enterprise architecture, rather than adapt your architecture to
    the
    middleware. </p>
